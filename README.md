## Project Description

- Explora is a web application that allows travellers to hire cars of their choice for ease in transportation in the destination area. 
- Clients can view existing cars model, year, fuel consumption, fuel type, transmission, number of seats and if available. 
- Clients are allowed to create their own accounts to keep track of their booking history. The accounts can be deleted at any time by them. Data privacy is respected.
- Cars are booked according to location and once booked, they cannot be double booked.

## Project Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Explora project locally, follow these steps:
- **FrontEnd repository:** Clone the frontend repository using the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:mumbi-prog/ExploraCars-Client.git
```
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd explora-client`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
   
- **BackEnd repository:**  Clone the backend repository using the following command:
```
git@github.com:mumbi-prog/Explora-cars.git
```
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd explora-cars`
2. Install dependencies: `bundle`
3. Set up and seed the database: `rails db:migrate db:seed`
4. Start the server: `rails s`

## Start the development server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## BackEnd Installation

Make sure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check by running ruby -v in the terminal. If it's not installed, download and install Ruby from the official website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

`ruby "2.7.4"`

## Ruby Dependencies

Add the following gems and then run `bundle install`

```bash
source "https://rubygems.org"
git_source(:github) { |repo| "https://github.com/#{repo}.git" }
gem "rails", "~> 7.0.7", ">= 7.0.7.2"
gem "pg", "~> 1.1"
gem "puma", "~> 5.0"
gem 'redis', '~> 4.0'
gem 'bcrypt', '~> 3.1.7'
gem 'bootsnap', '>= 1.4.4', require: false
gem "tzinfo-data", platforms: %i[ mingw mswin x64_mingw jruby ]
gem "rack-cors"
gem 'rack-attack', '~> 6.7'
gem "active_model_serializers", "~> 0.10.13"
gem "faker", "~> 3.2"
```

## PostgreSQL Installation

Using Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. Install the Package Manager: Open a terminal and run the following commands:
`sudo apt update sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`

2. PostgreSQL Global Development Group's APT Repository (recommended): Add the PostgreSQL Global Development Group's APT repository to your system and install PostgreSQL by running the following commands: `sudo apt update sudo apt install postgresql`
For Windows and macOS versions, refer to the internet documentation.

3. Start the PostgreSQL Server: The installation process typically starts the PostgreSQL server automatically. 
If not, you can start it manually using the following command: `sudo service postgresql start`

4. Create a PostgreSQL User and Database: By default, PostgreSQL creates a user named "postgres" during installation. 
You can use this user or create a new one. To create a new user and a database, follow these steps:

Log in as the "postgres" user: `sudo -u postgres psql`

Create a new user and database (replace "username" and "database_name" with your desired values): 
`CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';`
`CREATE DATABASE database_name OWNER username;`

Grant necessary privileges to the user (optional): `ALTER USER username CREATEDB;`

Exit the PostgreSQL prompt: `\q`

5. Configure PostgreSQL Authentication: By default, PostgreSQL uses peer authentication on Unix-like systems. 
You may want to change this to password authentication or use other authentication methods. Update the `pg_hba.conf` file to configure authentication.

Connect to PostgreSQL: You can now connect to PostgreSQL using the command-line client `"psql"` or a graphical client like pgAdmin.

## Set up basic backend structure

Define Models
There's a total of 5 models:

**`Customer`**

- Attributes: email, password_digest (for authentication), full_name, age (btn 18 and 65), phone_number
- Relationships: One-to-Many with Booking
- Routes: Sign Up, Log In, Log Out

**`Car`**

- Attributes: make, year, price_per_day, is_rented, transmission (automatic, manual, semi-automatic), body_type(vans, pickup truck, SUVâ€¦etc), category (luxury, sport, compact .etc) fuel_consumption, no_of_seats, fuel_type(gasoline, diesel, electric. Etc)
- Relationships: One-to-one with Booking 
- Routes: List all cars, View car details

**`Booking`**

- Attributes: start_date, end_date, user_id, car_id, total_price
- Relationships: Belongs to User and Car
- Routes: Create, Read, Update, Delete booking

**`Location`**

- Attributes: name, address, phone_number
- Car belongs to location
- Routes: Location.cars

**`Review`**
- Attributes: body, title, rating, car_id
- Review belongs to car
- Routes: Create review

## Test Your API:

Use tools like ThunderBolt, or Postman, or your frontend application to test your API endpoints and make sure everything is working as expected.

## Live Site Deployment

Deploy your backend to a production server using platforms like Heroku or AWS or Vercel or Netlify.
Access the Transaction Tracker application on Railway via the following link: [Live Site](https://explora-cars-production.up.railway.app/customers). This link will take you to the backend of the application.
